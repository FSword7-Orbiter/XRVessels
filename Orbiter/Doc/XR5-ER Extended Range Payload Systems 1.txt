- Contents

Four (4) Containerised 20 foot payloads for the XR5 Vanguard comprising modular auxiliary main and scramjet fuel tanks, and two (2) life support payloads for LOX and H2O (non functional).

- Introduction

As mighty as the XR5 is, we all know how fuel thirsty she can be during extended atmospheric ops. 

This first release concentrates on extending the Vanguard's operational range and mission duration. Future releases will provide more modular cargo options for simulated cargo flights.

Derived from Orbiter Multiplayer roleplaying activities involving suborbital commercial flights. Transglobal delivery in 2 hours, anyone?

- Support

Access the four new containers from the Vanguard's Payload Manager accessible from the rear camera of the 2D panel interface. (Ctrl + up arrow for the upper console and select payload view)

There are presently no docking ports on the emergency resupply valves of the life support containers.
